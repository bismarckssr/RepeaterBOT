# RepeaterBOT - 0.1.0-alpha-alpha

## Introduction üëã
RepeaterBOT is a telegram bot created to facilitate the management of ham radio repeaters, especially the digital ones, with resource usage in mind and code simplicity.
By using shell scripting, with `ksh` the bot is able to run on bare minimum software, without the need of complex interpreters, therefore saving as much space as possible, which sometimes is critical on repeater setups.

## Requirements üõ†Ô∏è

### 1. Prerequisites
In order to run the bot properly make sure to have the following software installed:
 - **`curl`** -> HTTP/S requests.
 - **`ksh`** -> Shell interpreter.
 - **`jq`** -> JSON parsing.
 - **`vnstat`** -> Monitors the traffic of network interfaces and gathers data.*
 - **`vnstati`** -> Generates images based off *vnstat*'s collected data.

Most likely you will be running a Debian-based Linux distribution, so here you go a quick install&run command:

    sudo apt install curl ksh jq vnstat vnstati
    sudo systemctl enable --now vnstat
##### *allow `vnstat` to run for a couple of minutes before trying to get the statistics.

### 2. Update ID requirement
Next, make sure to populate the `LAST_UPDATE_FILE` directive in the `.env.example` file with the *latest* `update_id` from the Telegram API reachable at: https://api.telegram.org/botTOKEN/getUpdates *
##### *make sure to replace "botTOKEN" with your token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather).

## Advices üì¢
Given the development stage of the bot, it is suggested to run it behind a Linux `screen` to keep it working in the background. 

## Features ‚≠ê
As of the [current version](https://semver.org/), 0.1.0-alpha, the bot offers:
 - **Efficient space and performance**: Thanks to `ksh` and its light-weight nature as opposed to the most known but resource-hungrier `bash`. The entire bot uses around 3MB of RAM.*
 - **Logging**: Logs all *commands* sent to it in a file specified within `.env.example`.
 - **Interface statistics**: Specific, daily, network interface monitoring with image generation under the bot command `/dailyStats`.
 ##### * Resident Set Size(RSS) value in a non-swap enabled system.
